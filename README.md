# Multi-threaded-port-scanner

## Overview
This is an advanced multi-threaded port scanner built in Python, designed for high-speed scanning of a target hostâ€™s open ports within a specified range. The script efficiently utilizes threading to speed up the scanning process and includes additional enhancements such as service detection, error handling, and progress tracking.

## Features
- Highly efficient multi-threaded scanning for rapid results
- Service detection for identifying common applications running on open ports
- Improved error handling for increased stability
- Automatic detection of localhost if no host is specified
- Customizable thread count for optimal performance tuning
- Live progress indicator to track scanning status
- Enhanced output formatting for better readability

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
```

## Usage
Run the script using:
```bash
python port_scanner.py <target_host> -p <start_port>-<end_port> -t <threads>
```

### Examples:
- Scan all ports (default: 1-1024) on a specific host:
  ```bash
  python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1
  ```
- Scan ports 20-1000 on a target with 200 threads:
  ```bash
  python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -p 20-1000 -t 200
  ```
- Scan your own machine (localhost) with 50 threads:
  ```bash
  python port_scanner.py -t 50
  ```

## How It Works
1. The script initializes a banner and prepares multi-threading.
2. Ports are added to a queue, and multiple threads begin scanning simultaneously.
3. If a port is open, the script displays the port number along with its associated service.
4. Real-time progress is shown, updating as scanning proceeds.
5. At the end, a summary of all open ports is displayed along with the total scanning time.
